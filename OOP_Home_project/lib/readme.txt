Dependencies will be stored in this directory.

It's conventional to not store other people's code in your own GitHub repository so as to keep the repository focused on your own code. Contemporary development techniques use build systems, such as Gradle or Maven, to automatically download any required dependencies from online resources.  However, we may have included a few external dependency libraries in this repository so you don't have to worry about installing them or using a build system.
